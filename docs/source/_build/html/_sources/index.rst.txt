utdf2gmns is a tool to convert utdf file to GMNS format:  **synchro utdf format to gmns signal timing format at movement layer**

**If you use utdf2gmns in your research, please cite: https://github.com/xyluo25/utdf2gmns**

Required Data Input Files:
--------------------------


* [X] UTDF.csv
* [X] node.csv (GMNS format)
* [X] movement.csv (GMNS format)

**Produced outputs**
------------------------

**If input folder have UTDF.csv only, outputs are:**

* A dictionary store utdf data with keys: Networks, Node, Links, Timeplans, Lanes, and utdf_intersection
* A file named utdf2gmns.pickle to store dictionary object.

**If input folder have extra node.csv and movement.csv, outputs are:**

* Two files named:  movement_utdf.csv and utdf_intersection.csv

Sample results: `datasets <https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/utdf2gmns/tree/main/datasets>`_


**Package dependencies**
------------------------

* [X] geocoder==1.38.1
* [X] pandas==1.4.4

**Data Conversion Steps**
-------------------------

Step 1: Read UTDF.csv file and perform geocoding, then produce utdf_geo, utdf_lane, and utdf_phase_timeplans.

Step 2: Match four files (utdf_geo, node, utdf_lane, utdf_pahse_timeplans, movement) to produce movement_utdf
